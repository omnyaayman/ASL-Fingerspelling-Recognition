## 📝 *Project Description*

This project applies *AI* techniques to analyze and predict outcomes based on a given dataset classifying ASL fingerspelling letters (A-Z) from hand-gesture images.

Using deep-learning techniques (CNNs), the model learns visual features such as finger position, hand shape, and orientation.

Once trained, the system can accurately recognize ASL letters and display the result to the user through a clean, easy-to-use interface.

This project combines:

Data preprocessing

Deep-learning model training

Evaluation and performance visualization

GUI integration

to deliver a complete ASL recognition tool.
We developed:
- A *clean dataset* 🧹  
- A *trained ML model* 🤖  
- A *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* to interact with the model 🎨  
- Full documentation & organized structure 📂  

The system allows users to:
- Import or view data  
- Train or load the model  
- Make predictions  
- Visualize results (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, etc.)
