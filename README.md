## 📝 *Project Description*
This project focuses on building an Al-based system that recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling letters (A-Z) using machine-learning and deep-learning techniques.

The system takes hand-gesture images as input, processes them, and predicts the correct ASL letter by analyzing features such as:

Finger position

Hand shape

Gesture orientation

The project includes:

Dataset preprocessing to clean and prepare the images

Training a deep-learning model (CNN) to classify the letters

Evaluating the model using accuracy, loss curves, and performance metrics

Building a GUI that allows users to load the model, view images, and get instant predictions

This results in a complete ASL recognition tool that can help users understand or translate ASL letters using machine learning.

to deliver a complete ASL recognition tool.
We developed:
- A *clean dataset* 🧹  
- A *trained ML model* 🤖  
- A *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* to interact with the model 🎨  
- Full documentation & organized structure 📂  

The system allows users to:
- Import or view data  
- Train or load the model  
- Make predictions  
- Visualize results (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, etc.)
